  <h1>Module 4: HTML Editors</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction to popular HTML text editors and IDEs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Explanation of text editors: Learners will understand the role of text editors in writing and editing HTML code. They will be introduced to the concept of plain text editors and how they are essential for working with markup languages like HTML.</li>
    <li>Overview of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Introduction to IDEs and their advantages, such as code autocompletion, debugging tools, and integrated terminal capabilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Choosing an HTML editor:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparison of popular HTML text editors and IDEs: Learners will explore and compare well-known HTML editors and IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Brackets. The features, community support, and extensibility of each editor will be discussed.</li>
    <li>Considering personal preferences: Factors to consider when choosing an HTML editor, including ease of use, platform compatibility, and available extensions/plugins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Setting up and configuring the chosen HTML editor (Visual Studio Code):</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Downloading Visual Studio Code: Go to the official Visual Studio Code website (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>) and click on the download button suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</li>
    <li>Installing Visual Studio Code: Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.</li>
    <li>Opening Visual Studio Code: Launch Visual Studio Code after successful installation.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Installing essential plugins and extensions for HTML development:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Extensions view in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or use the shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+X).</li>
    <li>Search for "HTML" in the Extensions view search box.</li>
    <li>Install popular HTML-related extensions like "HTML Snippets," "Auto Close Tag," "Prettier - Code formatter," and "HTML CSS Support" to enhance your HTML development experience.</li>
    <li>Click on the "Install" button next to each extension to install them.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Configuring preferences:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Accessing settings: Click on "File" in the menu, then select "Preferences," and choose "Settings." Alternatively, use the shortcut (Ctrl+,) to open the settings.</li>
    <li>Customizing HTML-specific settings: Search for "HTML" in the search bar at the top of the settings page. Adjust preferences like indentation, auto-closing tags, and other HTML-specific settings based on your coding preferences.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Outcomes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Knowledge of various HTML editors and IDEs: Learners will be familiar with different tools available for writing HTML code and their respective features.</li>
    <li>Informed decision-making: By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each editor, learners can make an informed choice based on their needs and preferences.</li>
    <li>Enhanced productivity: Setting up and configuring the chosen HTML editor with relevant plugins will improve coding efficiency and accuracy.</li>
    <li>Preparedness for the next modules: With Visual Studio Code or their preferred HTML editor in place, learners will be ready to delve into more advanced HTML concepts covered in subsequent modules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the end of Module 4, learners will have chosen and set up their preferred HTML editor or IDE, providing them with a solid foundation for creating and managing HTML projects throughout the course.</p>
