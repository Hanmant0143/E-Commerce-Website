  <h1>Module 22: HTML Block & Inline</h1>

  <p><strong>1. Introduction to Block and Inline Elements:</strong></p>
  <p>In HTML, elements are categorized as either block-level or inline based on their default display behavior. Understanding the difference between block and inline elements is crucial for controlling layout and formatting on web pages.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Block-Level Elements:</strong></p>
  <p>Block-level elements, like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, and &lt;li&gt;, start on a new line and take up the full width available by default. They create visible block boxes that act as containers for content, allowing you to structure and organize sections of your webpage. Block-level elements can also have margins, padding, and borders that separate them from other elements on the page.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Inline Elements:</strong></p>
  <p>Inline elements, like &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;br&gt;, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary for their content. They are used for styling and formatting within a block-level element. For example, you can use inline elements to apply specific styles, such as bold or italic text, within a paragraph.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Impact on Layout:</strong></p>
  <p>Block-level elements affect the layout by creating distinct blocks of content, which can be stacked vertically or placed side by side using CSS properties. They are commonly used for creating the main structure of a webpage, such as headers, paragraphs, and navigation menus.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Impact on Formatting:</strong></p>
  <p>Inline elements, on the other hand, do not create new blocks but rather flow within the text content. They are ideal for applying styles to specific parts of the text, such as making a word bold or inserting an image within a paragraph.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Changing Display Behavior:</strong></p>
  <p>You can change the default display behavior of elements using CSS. For example, you can change an inline element to display as a block-level element and vice versa. This allows you to customize the layout and formatting of your webpage based on your design requirements.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Best Practices:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use block-level elements for major structural elements of your webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.</li>
    <li>Reserve inline elements for applying specific formatting and styles within the text content.</li>
    <li>Always maintain proper HTML nesting to ensure correct rendering and avoid layout issues.</li>
    <li>Use CSS to control the layout and formatting of elements, whether block-level or inline, to achieve the desired design.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>8. Practical Exercises:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a block-level element to represent a section on your webpage and apply some styling to it.</li>
    <li>Experiment with inline elements to format and emphasize specific parts of a paragraph.</li>
    <li>Combine block-level and inline elements to create a well-structured and visually appealing webpage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Understanding the distinction between block and inline elements is essential for effective webpage design and layout. By utilizing these elements appropriately and using CSS to control their display behavior, you can create professional and aesthetically pleasing webpages.</p>
