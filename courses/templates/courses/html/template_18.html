  <h1>Module 19: HTML Page Title</h1>

  <p><strong>1. Introduction to Page Title:</strong></p>
  <p>The page title is an essential element in HTML that defines the title of a web page. It appears in the browser's title bar or tab, providing users with a brief and meaningful description of the page's content. The page title is crucial for both search engine optimization (SEO) and user experience, making it a fundamental aspect of web development.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Setting the Page Title:</strong></p>
  <p>To set the page title, you use the <title> element within the <head> section of your HTML document. Here's the basic syntax:</p>
  <pre>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
  &lt;title>Your Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>
  <p>Replace "Your Page Title" with the desired title for your web page.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Importance of Page Title for SEO:</strong></p>
  <p>Search engines use the page title as one of the key factors to determine the relevance and subject matter of a web page. It is displayed as the main heading in search engine results, making it the first impression for potential visitors. Including relevant keywords in the page title can improve the page's ranking in search engine results, increasing its visibility to users.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Impact on Browser Display:</strong></p>
  <p>The page title not only influences search engine results but also affects the user's browsing experience. When users open multiple tabs, the page title is displayed in each tab, helping them identify and differentiate between different web pages. A clear and descriptive page title contributes to better user navigation and understanding of the content.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Best Practices for Page Titles:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep the page title concise and descriptive, ideally within 50-60 characters to avoid truncation in search engine results.</li>
    <li>Incorporate relevant keywords that accurately represent the page's content, but avoid keyword stuffing.</li>
    <li>Create unique page titles for each web page on your site to provide clear distinctions between pages.</li>
    <li>Ensure the page title accurately reflects the actual content of the page to avoid misleading users.</li>
    <li>Test the page title on different devices and browsers to ensure it displays correctly and consistently.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>6. Practical Exercises:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review the page titles of existing web pages on your website and optimize them for better SEO.</li>
    <li>Create a new web page and set an appropriate page title that reflects the page's content.</li>
    <li>Test how the page title appears in different browsers and screen sizes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The page title is a critical element for SEO, user experience, and web accessibility. By crafting meaningful and optimized page titles, you can improve your website's search engine ranking and provide users with clear and accurate descriptions of your web pages.</p>
