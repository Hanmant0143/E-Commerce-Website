  <h1>Module 11: HTML Formatting</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction to HTML Formatting:</h2>
  <p>
    In HTML, text formatting plays a significant role in enhancing the visual presentation and readability of web pages.
    By applying various formatting options, you can emphasize important content, create visual hierarchy, and improve
    the overall user experience. This module introduces several HTML tags and attributes that allow you to format text effectively.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Bold Text:</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong> and <b> tags are used to make text bold. Both tags visually render the text in a bold font, but the
    <strong> tag carries more semantic meaning, indicating stronger importance. Use the <strong> tag for text that is
    essential to the content and the <b> tag for stylistic purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Italic Text:</h2>
  <p>
    The <em> and <i> tags are used to italicize text. Similar to bold tags, the <em> tag carries more semantic meaning and
    should be used for text with emphasized importance. The <i> tag is used for stylistic purposes only, indicating text that
    is set in an alternative font style.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Underline Text:</h2>
  <p>
    The <u> tag is used to underline text. However, underlining text is generally discouraged for body content as it is
    conventionally associated with hyperlinks. Instead, use CSS to apply underline styles to specific elements, such as hyperlinks.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Strikethrough Text:</h2>
  <p>
    The <s> tag is used to apply a strikethrough effect to text. It visually indicates that the text is no longer valid or relevant.
    Strikethrough is commonly used for indicating deleted or outdated information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Superscript and Subscript Text:</h2>
  <p>
    The <sup> and <sub> tags are used to create superscript and subscript text, respectively. Superscript text appears above the baseline,
    while subscript text appears below the baseline. These tags are often used for mathematical expressions, chemical formulas, and footnotes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Inline Code and Keyboard Input:</h2>
  <p>
    The <code> and <kbd> tags are used to represent inline code and keyboard input, respectively. The <code> tag displays text as monospaced font,
    typically used for indicating code snippets. The <kbd> tag is used for representing text that simulates user input, such as keyboard shortcuts.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Semantic Text Styling:</h2>
  <p>
    When applying text formatting, it's essential to use tags that convey semantic meaning. Use <strong>, <em>, and other semantic tags to add
    emphasis, importance, or special meaning to text. This practice not only enhances the visual appearance but also improves accessibility for
    screen readers and other assistive technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Text Styling and Accessibility:</h2>
  <p>
    When styling text, consider accessibility to ensure that all users can access and comprehend the content. Avoid relying solely on color for
    conveying information. Ensure there is sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability. Use CSS to adjust font sizes,
    line spacing, and letter spacing to improve accessibility.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Challenges (For experienced students):</h2>
