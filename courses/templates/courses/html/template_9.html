    <h1>Module 10: HTML Styles</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Introduction to HTML Styles:</strong></p>
    <p>
        In web development, styling is a crucial aspect of creating visually appealing and engaging web pages. HTML provides
        several methods to apply styles to elements, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual
        aspects of the content. This module introduces two common ways of applying styles in HTML: inline styles and internal
        styles.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Inline Styles in HTML:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Inline styles involve adding CSS directly within the HTML elements using the "style" attribute. This approach allows you
        to apply styles to individual elements with precision. Inline styles are useful for making quick style adjustments or
        applying styles to specific elements when external or internal stylesheets are not required.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3. Internal Styles in HTML:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Internal styles are defined within the HTML document using the <style> element in the head section. Unlike inline styles,
        internal styles affect multiple elements at once. This method is suitable for smaller projects or when external stylesheets
        are not necessary. However, for larger projects, using external stylesheets is recommended for better organization and
        maintainability.
    </p>

    <p><strong>4. CSS Selectors:</strong></p>
    <p>
        CSS selectors are patterns used to target specific HTML elements for styling. They allow you to apply styles to elements
        based on their tag names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. Understanding CSS selectors is essential for effectively
        applying styles to elements within your web page.
    </p>

    <p><strong>5. External Stylesheets:</strong></p>
    <p>
        External stylesheets are separate CSS files linked to the HTML document using the <link> element in the head section. This
        approach keeps the styles separate from the HTML, making it easier to maintain and reuse styles across multiple pages.
        External stylesheets are commonly used in professional web development to promote a more organized and modular approach to
        styling.
    </p>

    <p><strong>6. CSS Comments:</strong></p>
    <p>
        CSS comments allow you to add notes or explanations within your stylesheets for yourself or other developers. Comments do not
        affect the appearance of the page but provide valuable insights into the purpose of certain styles or sections of code. Use
        comments to document your styles and make the code more readable and understandable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7. Cascading Order:</strong></p>
    <p>
        When multiple styles are applied to the same element, the cascading order determines which style takes precedence. The
        cascading order is based on the specificity of the selector, the order in which styles are defined, and the use of important
        declarations. Understanding the cascading order is crucial for avoiding conflicts and ensuring that styles are applied as
        intended.
    </p>

    <p><strong>8. CSS Box Model:</strong></p>
    <p>
        The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how elements are rendered on the page. It consists of
        content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is essential for controlling the spacing and layout of
        elements, ensuring a consistent design across your web page.
    </p>
