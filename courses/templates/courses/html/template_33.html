  <h1>Module 34: HTML Entities</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>In HTML, certain characters have special meanings and are reserved for specific purposes. For example, the less-than symbol (<) and the ampersand (&) are used to define HTML tags and entities, respectively. When you want to display these characters as regular text instead of having their reserved functionality, you need to use HTML entities.</p>
    <p>HTML entities are codes that represent special characters and symbols. They start with an ampersand (&) followed by a specific keyword and end with a semicolon (;). Using HTML entities ensures that these characters are correctly rendered and helps avoid character encoding issues.</p>

    <h2>Commonly Used HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>Here are some commonly used HTML entities and their corresponding characters:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>HTML Entity</th>
        <th>Character</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;lt;</td>
        <td>&lt;</td>
        <td>Less-than symbol</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;gt;</td>
        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td>Greater-than symbol</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;amp;</td>
        <td>&amp;</td>
        <td>Ampersand</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;quot;</td>
        <td>&quot;</td>
        <td>Double quotation mark</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;apos;</td>
        <td>'</td>
        <td>Single quotation mark (apostrophe)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Non-breaking space</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>There are many more HTML entities available for various special characters, symbols, and accented letters. You can refer to the official HTML documentation for a complete list.</p>

    <h2>Avoiding Character Encoding Issues</h2>
    <p>Character encoding issues can occur when special characters and symbols are not properly handled in web documents. If character encoding is incorrect, it may lead to display errors, broken characters, or unexpected behavior in the web page.</p>
    <p>To avoid character encoding issues, use appropriate HTML entities for special characters and symbols. Additionally, ensure that the web page's character encoding is correctly set in the <meta> tag within the <head> section of your HTML document.</p>
    <pre>
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</pre>
    <p>The "UTF-8" character encoding is widely used and supports a wide range of characters from various languages.</p>
