    <h1>Module 14: HTML Colors</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Color Representation in HTML:</h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, colors play a crucial role in web design and visual appeal. Colors are represented using various formats, such as named colors, hexadecimal values, RGB, and HSL values.
        Understanding how to specify colors in HTML allows you to apply color to text, backgrounds, and elements, creating visually appealing and engaging web pages.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Named Colors:</h2>
    <p>
        HTML provides a set of predefined named colors that you can directly use without specifying any additional values. For example, you can use "red," "blue," "green," "yellow," and many others.
        While named colors are convenient, they offer a limited range of choices and might not precisely match the desired color for your design.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;This text is in red color.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>3. Hexadecimal Colors:</h2>
    <p>
        Hexadecimal colors are represented using a combination of six alphanumeric characters, preceded by a hash (#) symbol. Each pair of characters represents the intensity of red, green, and blue colors.
        The hexadecimal format offers a wide range of color options, making it popular in web design. You can use online color pickers to find the hexadecimal value for your desired color.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;p style="color: #00ff00;"&gt;This text is in green color using hexadecimal value.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>4. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Colors:</h2>
    <p>
        RGB colors are represented using three values for red, green, and blue colors, ranging from 0 to 255. For example, (255, 0, 0) represents pure red, (0, 255, 0) represents pure green, and (0, 0, 255) represents pure blue.
        By combining different RGB values, you can create a vast array of colors. RGB is particularly useful when you need to fine-tune colors with specific intensity.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"&gt;This text is in blue color using RGB value.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>5. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) Colors:</h2>
    <p>
        HSL colors represent colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is represented by an angle (0 to 360 degrees) on the color wheel, saturation controls the intensity of the color, and lightness determines how light or dark the color appears.
        The HSL format provides a more intuitive way to work with colors, especially when adjusting the overall appearance and shade of a color.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;p style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);"&gt;This text is in green color using HSL value.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>6. Applying Colors to Backgrounds:</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to text color, you can apply colors to backgrounds using the "background-color" property in CSS. This allows you to customize the background of elements like divs, sections, and the entire page.
        Remember to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to maintain readability and accessibility.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;div style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with a custom background color.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>7. Color Contrast and Accessibility:</h2>
    <p>
        When choosing colors for your web page, consider accessibility for all users, including those with visual impairments. Ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors to make the content readable.
        Online tools and guidelines are available to help you check color contrast and adhere to accessibility standards.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Practical Application:</h2>
    <p>
        Experiment with different color representations and apply them to various elements on your web page. Observe how colors impact the overall design and user experience.
        Use contrast checking tools to verify the accessibility of your chosen color combinations.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Challenges (For experienced students):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a color palette for your website that complements your brand and design.</li>
        <li>Implement color transitions and animations using CSS to add dynamic visual effects.</li>
    </ul>
