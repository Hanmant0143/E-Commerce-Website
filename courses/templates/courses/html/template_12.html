    <h1>Module 13: HTML Comments</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction to HTML Comments:</h2>
    <p>
        HTML comments are non-rendered text that provides developers with a way to add notes and explanations within the code.
        They are intended for documentation and clarity, allowing developers to leave comments about specific sections, code blocks, or elements.
        Comments are not displayed on the web page and are only visible in the source code.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Syntax for HTML Comments:</h2>
    <p>
        HTML comments are written using the &lt;!-- ... --&gt; syntax. Anything placed between the opening &lt;!-- and closing --&gt; tags will be considered a comment.
        Comments can span multiple lines and can contain any text, including code-related explanations or reminders.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>3. Best Practices for Commenting in HTML:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be Clear and Concise: Write comments that are easy to understand and provide clear explanations. Avoid overly technical jargon that might be confusing to other developers.</li>
        <li>Use Comments Sparingly: While comments are valuable, excessive commenting can clutter the code and make it harder to read. Use comments only when necessary to explain complex code or to highlight critical points.</li>
        <li>Comment Complex Code Sections: If you have complex or tricky code, add comments to explain the logic or purpose behind it. This helps other developers (and even yourself in the future) understand the code's intention.</li>
        <li>Comment TODOs and FIXMEs: Use comments to mark TODOs for unfinished tasks or FIXMEs for known issues that need to be addressed later. This allows developers to easily find and address pending tasks.</li>
        <li>Avoid Redundant Comments: Do not add comments that merely repeat what the code already says. Comments should complement the code, not repeat it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. HTML Comments for Debugging:</h2>
    <p>
        Comments can be used for debugging purposes. During development, you can comment out sections of code that are causing errors or unexpected behavior.
        By doing so, you can isolate problematic code and check if the issues persist. Just remember to remove these comments before deploying the code to the production environment.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Accessibility Considerations:</h2>
    <p>
        Although comments are not visible on the web page, they are accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        As such, avoid leaving irrelevant or inappropriate comments that could confuse users relying on assistive devices.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Practical Application:</h2>
    <p>
        Practice using HTML comments in your projects. Add comments to explain your code's logic, describe the purpose of specific elements, or highlight important sections.
        Review your code later to see how helpful the comments are in understanding the codebase.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Challenges (For experienced students):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborate on a project with other developers and use comments effectively to improve code understanding and collaboration.</li>
        <li>Explore the use of build tools and preprocessors that can strip comments from the production code to reduce file size.</li>
    </ul>
