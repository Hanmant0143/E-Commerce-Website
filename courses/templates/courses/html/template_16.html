  <h1>Module 17: HTML Images</h1>

  <p><strong>1. Introduction to Inserting and Optimizing Images in HTML:</strong></p>
  <p>Images are a crucial part of web design, as they enhance the visual appeal of web pages and convey information effectively. In HTML, you can insert images using the &lt;img&gt; element. When adding images to your website, it's essential to optimize them for web use to ensure faster loading times and better user experience.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Inserting Images:</strong></p>
  <p>To insert an image, use the &lt;img&gt; element and specify the image source (URL) using the "src" attribute. Here's the basic syntax:</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="image_url" alt="Image Description"&gt;</pre>
  <p>Replace "image_url" with the URL of the image file and "Image Description" with a concise description of the image content. The alt attribute provides alternative text that is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or read by screen readers.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Optimizing Images:</strong></p>
  <p>Before adding images to your website, optimize them by resizing and compressing them without compromising quality. Smaller image sizes reduce page load times, which is crucial for improving website performance. Use image editing tools or online compressors to achieve the right balance between image quality and file size.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Adding Alternative Text (Alt Text):</strong></p>
  <p>The "alt" attribute in the &lt;img&gt; element provides alternative text for the image. This text is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or when users are using screen readers to access the content. It's essential to write descriptive and meaningful alt text that conveys the image's purpose and content to visually impaired users.</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="image_url" alt="A beautiful landscape with mountains and a lake"&gt;</pre>

  <p><strong>5. Image Accessibility:</strong></p>
  <p>Providing proper alt text is critical for making images accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. Screen readers rely on alt text to describe images to users who cannot see them. Additionally, use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, SVG) depending on the image's characteristics and requirements.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Image File Formats:</strong></p>
  <p>Choose the right image file format based on the image's content and purpose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JPEG: Best for photographs and images with gradients or millions of colors.</li>
    <li>PNG: Suitable for images with transparency or sharp edges, such as logos or icons.</li>
    <li>SVG: Ideal for vector graphics and scalable images.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>7. Image Dimensions and Aspect Ratios:</strong></p>
  <p>Specify image dimensions using the "width" and "height" attributes in the &lt;img&gt; element. This helps the browser allocate space for the image before it loads, preventing layout shifts. Always maintain the image's original aspect ratio to avoid distortion.</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="image_url" alt="Image Description" width="400" height="300"&gt;</pre>

  <p><strong>8. Lazy Loading Images:</strong></p>
  <p>Use the "loading" attribute with the value "lazy" to enable lazy loading of images. Lazy loading delays the loading of off-screen images until the user scrolls near them, reducing initial page load times.</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="image_url" alt="Image Description" loading="lazy"&gt;</pre>

  <p><strong>9. Image SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</strong></p>
  <p>Optimize images for SEO by using descriptive filenames and relevant alt text. Properly named images can improve your website's search engine rankings and make it more discoverable in image searches.</p>

  <p><strong>10. Practical Exercises:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add images to a webpage and optimize them for web use.</li>
    <li>Write descriptive alt text for the images to ensure accessibility.</li>
    <li>Experiment with different image formats to understand their strengths and use cases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By following these best practices for inserting and optimizing images in HTML, you can create visually appealing and accessible web pages that engage and delight your website visitors.</p>
